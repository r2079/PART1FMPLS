2. Rsvp operatinal overview 

- Rsvp creates sessions to handle each flow 
- destination address , an optional destination port, and a protocol - identifies session 
- sender - identified by source address and source port 

sequence of events 

- PATH message is initiated by the sender 
- Receiver receives the path message 
- Sends RESERVE message (Resv) to sender 
- flow descriptor - used by Routers along the path for reservations
- sender receives RESV message and sends the data 


LSP 

 - label switched path 
 - As the name suggests the label gets switched along the path - here Label is MPLS label and Rsvp helps to establish it 
 - Rsvp helps in Traffic engineering and bandwidth allocation 
 - uses CSPF and EROs both discussed in coming topics 
 - you configure the interfaces just like LDP 
 - authentication , explicit path and link coloring - differentiates RSVP vs LDP

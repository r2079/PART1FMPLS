3. RSVP Fundamentals 

-   Rsvp version 1 
-   Monitors the status of the IGP to detect when a node fails 
-   when nodes fails, something called Path Error Message is generated and RSVP session goes down. Path Err will be discussed below
-   RSVP has hellos as well, used mostly when IGP on neighbor isnt support 
-   Advice from Juniper, configure timers / fast timers for igp instead of RSVP
